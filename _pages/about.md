I am a PhD student in computer science studying machine learning at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I am grateful to [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellowship](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) and [Premium Research Studentships](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/rs-premium) for funding my PhD studies. My research focuses on causality in exchangeable data and reasoning in language models. 

I did Master in Machine Learning with [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/) at UCL and Master in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. I was supervised by [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) during my undergraduate time working on variable selection in high-dimensional statistical inference. I obtained BA in Mathematics with Distinction from the University of Cambridge.
