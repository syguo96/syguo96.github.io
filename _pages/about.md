I am a PhD student in computer science studying machine learning at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I am grateful to [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellowship](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) and [Premium Research Studentships](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/rs-premium) for funding my PhD studies. 

My research interests are on scientific induction (a.k.a causality) and non-i.i.d. data. I am interested in building theoretical foundations of causality in non-i.i.d. data:
from Causal de Finetti (NeurIPS 2022) to _Do_ Finetti (Under review), 
from _out-of-distribution_ to _out-of-variable_ (ICLR 2023). 

The quest to understand _why machines learn_ relies on the fundamental assumption that train and test data come from i.i.d. data. **BUT** animals including humans do not perform data shuffling in our life experiences of absorbing information flows. We learn in non-linear, complex, dependent ways. And the quest to understand learning in non-i.i.d. setting has just begun: exchangeable and out-of-variable data offers a realistic and doable next step. 

I did Master in Machine Learning with [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/) at UCL and Master in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. I was supervised by [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) during my undergraduate time working on variable selection in high-dimensional statistical inference. I obtained BA in Mathematics with Distinction from the University of Cambridge.
